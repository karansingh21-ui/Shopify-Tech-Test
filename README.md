# M&P Frontend Technical Assessment

This assessment is an opportunity for us to see how you approach a task and also how you execute it. In short, this task is to consume the response from a GraphQL request to the products endpoint, then generate and display 3 product cards from this information. Product cards should contain at a minimum:
* An Image
* A Title
* A Description
* A Price
* A RRP Price
* A Buy Now button (Non working)

Since you have applied for a frontend position, we have supplied the GraphQL request for you and linked it to the fetch button already.

The task is to style the Page and Product Cards using CSS. You can create additional page elements if you wish to. Be mindful of the page being an E-Commerce Page, so care should be taken that the design you create will not put off potential customers by being unreadable, or unuseable.

We are evaluating:
* The readability of your code
* How you utilize git 
* How maintainable/conventional your code is
* How closely your submission follows the brief above
* The responsiveness of your solution

We are NOT looking for the fastest/shortest solution. We recommend using VS Code for this assessment. The `Live Server` extension will give you a realtime preview of your work.

To get started you should branch off this repository. Once your work is complete, zip the file and email it back to kenneth.gamble@mamasandpapas.com.
